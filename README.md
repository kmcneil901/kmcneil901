### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am glad you are here.

I am an aspiring Data Scientist skilled in Python, Tableau, ML, and AI, bringing 7 years of experience in project management, people management, and research. Unapologetically, I am a bookworm, particularly drawn to works where researchers make their findings accessible, such as "Why We Sleep," "Upstream," and "Rescuing Socrates," among others. I'm passionate about the intersection of data science and I/O psych (psychology of the workplace)â€” a shameless plug to check out my blog linked below. I thoroughly enjoy connecting on topics related to data science and/or psychology, so please make sure to reach out!
